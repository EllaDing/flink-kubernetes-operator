kubernetes.operator.periodic.savepoint.interval,"Option to enable automatic savepoint triggering. Can be specified either as a Duration type (i.e. '10m') or as a cron expression in Quartz format (6 or 7 positions, see http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html).The triggering schedule is not guaranteed, savepoints will be triggered as part of the regular reconcile loop. WARNING: not intended to be used together with the cron-based periodic savepoint triggering"
kubernetes.operator.periodic.checkpoint.interval,"Option to enable automatic checkpoint triggering. Can be specified either as a Duration type (i.e. '10m') or as a cron expression in Quartz format (6 or 7 positions, see http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html).The triggering schedule is not guaranteed, checkpoints will be triggered as part of the regular reconcile loop. NOTE: checkpoints are generally managed by Flink. This setting isn't meant to replace Flink's checkpoint settings, but to complement them in special cases. For instance, a full checkpoint might need to be occasionally triggered to break the chain of incremental checkpoints and consolidate the partial incremental files. WARNING: not intended to be used together with the cron-based periodic checkpoint triggering"
kubernetes.operator.watched.namespaces,Comma separated list of namespaces the operator monitors for custom resources.
kubernetes.operator.label.selector,Label selector of the custom resources to be watched. Please see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors for the format supported.
kubernetes.operator.dynamic.namespaces.enabled,Enables dynamic change of watched/monitored namespaces.

kubernetes.operator.job.upgrade.last-state-fallback.enabled,Enables last-state fallback for savepoint upgrade mode. When the job is not running thus savepoint cannot be triggered but HA metadata is available for last state restore the operator can initiate the upgrade process when the flag is enabled.
kubernetes.operator.job.upgrade.last-state.max.allowed.checkpoint.age,Max allowed checkpoint age for initiating last-state upgrades on running jobs. If a checkpoint is not available within the desired age (and nothing in progress) a savepoint will be triggered.

kubernetes.operator.health.probe.enabled,Enables health probe for the kubernetes operator.
kubernetes.operator.health.probe.port,The port the health probe will use to expose the status.
kubernetes.operator.startup.stop-on-informer-error,"Whether informer errors should stop operator startup. If false, the startup will ignore recoverable errors, caused for example by RBAC issues and will retry periodically."
kubernetes.operator.termination.timeout,Operator shutdown timeout before reconciliation threads are killed.
kubernetes.operator.cluster.health-check.enabled,Whether to enable health check for clusters.
kubernetes.operator.cluster.health-check.restarts.window,The duration of the time window where job restart count measured.
kubernetes.operator.cluster.health-check.restarts.threshold,The threshold which is checked against job restart count within a configured window. If the restart count is reaching the threshold then full cluster restart is initiated.
kubernetes.operator.cluster.health-check.checkpoint-progress.enabled,Whether to enable checkpoint progress health check for clusters.
kubernetes.operator.cluster.health-check.checkpoint-progress.window,"If no checkpoints are completed within the defined time window, the job is considered unhealthy. This must be bigger than checkpointing interval."

kubernetes.operator.health.canary.resource.timeout,Allowed max time between spec update and reconciliation for canary resources.
kubernetes.operator.jm-deployment.startup.probe.enabled,Enable job manager startup probe to allow detecting when the jobmanager could not submit the job.
kubernetes.operator.pod-template.merge-arrays-by-name,Configure the array merge behaviour during pod merging. Arrays can be either merged by position or name matching.
